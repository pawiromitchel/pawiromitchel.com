# Welcome to My Blog

This is your first blog post! It's written in MDX, which means you can use both **Markdown** and **React components** together.

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. Here are some features:

- **Markdown syntax** for easy writing
- **React components** for interactivity
- **Full JavaScript** expressions

## Getting Started

You can create new blog posts by adding `.mdx` files to the `app/blogs` directory. Each file needs to export a `metadata` object with:

- `title`: The blog post title
- `description`: A short description
- `date`: The publication date
- `tags`: An array of tags

## Example Post Structure

```mdx
export const metadata = {
  title: "Your Title",
  description: "Your description",
  date: "2025-02-02",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
};

# Your Title

Your content here...
```

That's it! Your blog is now ready to use with MDX.
