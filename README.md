Hey there! :wave:

This repo will be the home of my knowledge, collections and tooling. I'll try to keep this up-to-date as much as I can. I've been transitioning from Web2 to Web3 lately and I'll write about the journey as well :smile:

What I'll cover
1. My experience as a Software Engineer
2. `Node.js` tutorials & guides
3. Blockchain topics

Will be adding more, so stay tuned 

## Enjoy!
