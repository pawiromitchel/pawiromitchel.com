# How to get a remote job

Working from home has become the standard for most developers so getting a remote job is crucial. Nobody likes working in an office anymore lol
There are so many places where you can sign up, create a profile and start searching for gigs or applying for jobs.

Before applying to jobs, please put some work into your online profile and CV. 

1. Keep your LinkedIn profile up to date, you can use [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchel-pawirodinomo/) as reference if you want
2. Use a [Resume builder](https://rxresu.me/) like this one to get a nice looking CV

## General job searching

1. [UpWork](https://upwork.com/), UpWork is a great place to get familiar with doing freelance jobs. People and companies submit jobs, apply for them, and get paid via Payoneer or Wired Transfer.
2. [Angel.co](https://angel.co/l/2xoy8S), Angel.co is for actual job searching, full-time jobs. There are a veriety of different job types such as web3 development, devops, data science jobs, and more.
3. [Fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/ff13bb51bd), Fiverr is a little bit different, people need to reach out to you. Normally, it's the other way around.
4. [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
5. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies)
6. [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)

### Crypto jobs
This is a great place to start for anyone transitioning from the web2 space to web3. There are technical and non-technical jobs, and you can apply for them.

## Preparing for interviews
Preparation for interviews is critical for anyone who wants to get a job. Many resources and tools are available to help you prepare for interviews. Most of the time, interviews are split into parts.

[This Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/andylacivita) really helped to get a nice overview of how these remote interviews are 

### Introduction
There's a link that has helped me ace the introduction to interviews.
[Ultimate List of Interview Questions](https://www.gqrgm.com/ultimate-list-interview-questions-2018/)

Write down your achievements, skills, and projects in bullet points. The recruiter expects you to be quick and concise.

### Technical (Written and verbal)
For technical interviews, it's best to know and practice similar questions beforehand. Get to know the company's tech stack, environment, and position in the market.

- [Tips and Tricks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/interviewing-prep-tips-and-tricks/)

### Final interview
The recruiter will give you a summary of their thoughts and your experience throughout the process. During the discussion, you'll get a feeling if you're in or not. 

They'll also ask you for a desired salary, so keep this in mind. Research what the average pay is for the position you're applying for. [Average pay of a Software Engineer](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=average+pay+as+a+software+engineer)

## Getting paid :moneybag:
How will you get the money? Excellent question :laugh:

I use these platforms:

- [Payoneer](http://share.payoneer.com/nav/fQlm0pv7pQ7q4NRC_SLkwPXWJVe1murssnn1-imwpN5SO-vDQFCbzJYOJg5iq4YoBF-rXR3zsYKx2r5LnxgF9g2)
- [Wise, formerly TransferWise](https://wise.com/invite/u/mitchelp7)

I might do a seperate guide for this topic, so stay tuned.

Thank you very much :raised_hands:
