# Welcome

Hey :wave:, I'm Mitchel Pawirodinomo, a Software Engineer from Suriname. I've been coding since 2014, participated in many Hackathons and Coding challenges. I love challenging myself so the transition from trad web2 tech to web3 has been a blast so far!

My socials are in the footer so feel free to reach out and have a coffee with me if you wanna pick my brain.

## Goal of this website
This will be my home of all my knowledge, findings and collections of resources. I hope to spark and inspire others to share their knowledge as well.

Best of luck on your journey! You can achieve greatness if you put your mind into it :smile:
