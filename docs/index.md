# Welcome

Hey :wave:, I'm **Mitchel Pawirodinomo**, a Software Engineer from [Suriname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname). I've been coding since 2014, and throughout my career I've worked on diverse projects spanning Web3, backend development, security, and developer tools.

I'm currently a Software Engineer at **QuickNode**, building blockchain infrastructure for developers. I love challenging myself, and the transition from traditional web2 to web3 has been incredibly rewarding.
